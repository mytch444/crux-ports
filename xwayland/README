WARNING:

  If you fail to rebuild input and video packages for xorg-server
  on major ABI changes, eg. 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0. You will end up with
  no mouse or keyboard and possibly no direct 3D acceleration for video.

  If you do happen to forget and have sys-rq enabled in your kernel
  you can do a safe reboot with holding down Alt + SysRq, and typing the
  following sequence in order, pausing for several seconds between each key:

  reisub


POST-INSTALL

  After upgrading xorg-server, from major versions rebuild video
  and input packages:

  NOTE: This only applies on ABI changes between major versions
  eg, 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0.

prt-get update -fr $(prt-get listinst | egrep '^xorg-xf86-(input|video)') \
$(prt-get listinst | egrep '^mesa3d')

  If you use nvidia you also need to do this:

gl-select use xorg
prt-get update -fr $(prt-get listinst | grep 'nvidia')
gl-select use nvidia

  To avoid rebooting you can do this:

  NOTE: you have to exit xorg to do this.

rmmod nvidia
depmod -a
